amps-sqlite3: Python wrapper to make working with AMPS statistics sqlite3
              databases easier.

Usage:

  Run amps-sqlite3, just as you would the sqlite3 utility for browsing
  the AMPS statistics database with a provided database file and SQL
  statement string to execute.

Example:

  To get a list of ISO-8601 timestamps, in order, and the amount of system
    CPU time was in use, use the following command:

  ./amps-sqlite3 stats.db "select iso8601(timestamp),system_percent from hcpus order by timestamp"

  
Notes:

  The AMPS statistics database is split into seperate tables for each entity:
  one "dynamic" for frequently changing metrics and another "static" for
  rarely changing metrics and properties.  These tables have the suffixes
  "_DYNAMIC" and "_STATIC", respectively.

  For convenience, amps-sqlite3 creates temporary views that are joins from
  the dynamic and static tables, so that all the statistics are in one place
  easily consumed, filtered, and reviewed. For example, instead of joining
  HCPUS_DYNAMIC to HCPUS_STATIC on the static_id, you can just query HCPUS
  directly, which is the temporary view where this has already been done for
  you.

  Additionally, there are functions defined in this utility that you can
  use to simplify your queries and make it easier to use:

    iso8601(timestamp)      : Returns an ISO-8601 datetime in UTC
                              YYYYmmddTHHMMSS format.
    iso8601_local(timestamp): Returns an ISO-8601 datetime in local time
                              YYYYmmddTHHMMSS format.
    timestamp(string)       : Returns a numeric timestamp from an ISO-8601
                              UTC datetime string in the YYYYmmddTHHMMSS
                              format.
