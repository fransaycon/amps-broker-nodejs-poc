4. AMPS Expressions
====================

AMPS includes an expression language that combines elements of XPath and
SQL-92's ``WHERE`` clause. This expression language is used whenever the
AMPS server refers to the contents of a message, including:

-  Content filtering

-  Constructing fields for message enrichment

-  Creating projected fields for views

AMPS uses a common syntax for each of these purposes, and provides a
common set of operators and functions. AMPS also provides special
directives for message enrichment, and aggregation functions for
projecting views.

For example, when an expression is used as a content filter, any message
for which the expression returns ``true`` matches the content filter.
When an expression is used to construct a field for message enrichment
or view projection, the expression is evaluated and the result that the
expression returns is used as the content of the field.

Expressions Overview
--------------------

The quickest way to learn AMPS expressions is to think of each as a
combination of identifiers that tell AMPS where to find data in a
message, and operators that tell AMPS what to do with that data. Each
AMPS expression produces a value. The way AMPS uses that value depends
on where the expression is used. For example, in a content filter, AMPS
uses the value of the expression to determine whether a message matches
the filter. When constructing a field, AMPS uses the value of the
expression as the contents of the field.

Consider a simple example of an expression used as a filter. Imagine
AMPS receives the following JSON message:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {"name":"Gyro", "job":"kitten"}

Using an AMPS expression, you can easily construct a content filter that
matches the message:

.. code::

    /name = 'Gyro'

There are three parts to this expression. The first part, ``/name``, is
an *identifier* that tells AMPS to look for the contents of the ``name``
field at the top level of the JSON document. The second part of the
filter, ``=``, is the equality *operator*, which tells AMPS to compare
the values on either side of the operator and return ``true`` if the
values match. The final part of the filter, ``'Gyro'``, is a string
*literal* for the equality operator to use in the comparison. When an
expression is used in a content filter, a message matches the filter
when the expression returns ``true``. The expression returns ``true``
for the sample message, so the sample messages matches the filter.

The identifier syntax is a subset of XPath, as described in
:ref:`Identifiers<#ug-expression-identifiers>`. The comparison syntax is similar
to SQL-92.
