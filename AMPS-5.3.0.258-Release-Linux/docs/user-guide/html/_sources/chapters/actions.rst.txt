24. Automating AMPS With Actions
===================================

.. index:: Actions,

AMPS provides the ability to run scheduled tasks or respond to events,
such as Linux signals, using the Actions interface.

To create an action, you add an ``Actions`` section to the AMPS
configuration file. Each ``Action`` contains one (or more) ``On``
statement which specifies when the action occurs, and one (or more)
``Do`` statement which specifies what the AMPS server does for the
action. Within an action, AMPS performs each ``Do`` statement in the
order in which they appear in the file.


AMPS actions may require the use of parameters. AMPS allows you to use
variables in the parameters of an action. You can access these variables
using the following syntax:

``{{VARIABLE_NAME}}``

AMPS defines a set of default variables when running an action. The
event, or a previous action, can add variables in the context of the
action. Those variables can be expanded in subsequent parameters. If a
variable is used that isn't defined at the point where it is used, AMPS
will expand that variable to an empty string literal. The context can
also be updated as the module is running, so any variables that are
available at any given point in the file depend on what action was
previously executed.

By default, AMPS loads the following variables when it initializes an
AMPS action:

+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| Variable                       | Description                                |
+================================+============================================+
| ``AMPS_INSTANCE_NAME``         | The name of the AMPS instance.             |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| ``AMPS_BYTE_XX``               | Insert byte *XX*, where *XX* is a 2-digit  |
|                                | uppercase hex number (00-FF). AMPS expands |
|                                | this variable to the corresponding byte    |
|                                | value. These variables are useful for      |
|                                | creating field separators or producing     |
|                                | characters that are not permitted within   |
|                                | XML                                        |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| ``AMPS_DATETIME``              | The current date and time in ISO-8601      |
|                                | format.                                    |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| ``AMPS_UNIX_TIMESTAMP``        | The current date and time as a UNIX        |
|                                | timestamp.                                 |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+

**Table 24.1:** *Default Context Variables*

An example to echo a message when AMPS starts up is shown below. Note
the AMPS_INSTANCE_NAME is one of the variables that AMPS pushes to the
context when an action is loaded.

.. code-block:: xml

    <Actions>
        <Action>
            <On>
                <Module>amps-action-on-startup</Module>
            </On>
            <Do>
                <Module>amps-action-do-echo-message</Module>
                <Options>
                    <Message>instance={{AMPS_INSTANCE_NAME}}</Message>        
                </Options>
            </Do>
        </Action>
    </Actions>

AMPS actions are implemented as AMPS modules.  To run each statement, AMPS
simply calls the module that implements that ``Do`` statement. The module is
free to take any necessary actions. If a ``Do`` statement returns
a failure, AMPS does not run subsequent ``Do`` statements in that action.
This is intended to help make maintenance processes reliable. For example,
if a ``Do`` statement that is intended to copy a log file to a storage
directory fails because the device that holds the storage directory is
not mounted, further steps in the action -- which might do things like
remove the log file from the original directory -- should not be run. Likewise,
if AMPS exits unexpectedly during a given ``Do`` statement, subsequent
statements will not be run.

AMPS provides the modules described in the following sections by default.

.. include:: ./actions.inc
