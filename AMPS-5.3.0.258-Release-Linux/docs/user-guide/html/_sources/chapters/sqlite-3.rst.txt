34. The AMPS Statistics Database
=================================

AMPS provides the ability to record the statistics gathered from the
AMPS instance and the host machine. This appendix describes working with
the AMPS statistics database.

The AMPS statistics database is stored in sqlite3 format, and can be
used with any of the standard sqlite3 tools. This appendix assumes that
you are using the standard ``sqlite3`` package installed on your local
computer. While you may be able to run the SQL examples in this guide
using other packages, this guide will assume that all SQL commands will
be executed with ``sqlite3``.

Notice that the statistics subsystem is independent of the other
subsystems in AMPS, and is the only part of AMPS that uses the sqlite3
format. You cannot use sqlite3 tools with SOW files, journal files, or
.ack files: these files use formats specifically designed for high
performance messaging.

Configuring AMPS to Persist Statistics
----------------------------------------

By default, AMPS maintains statistics in memory. To configure AMPS to
record the statistics to a file, the following configuration options are
available in the AMPS configuration file to update the location and
frequency of the statistics database file.

.. code-block:: xml

    <AMPSConfig>
        <Name>AMPS-Sqlite</Name>
        <Admin>
            <InetAddr>localhost:9090</InetAddr>
            <FileName>./stats.db</FileName>
            <Interval>5s</Interval>
        </Admin>
     
        <!-- [snip] -->
    </AMPSConfig>

In the example listed above, the AMPS administration interface is set to
collect statistics every 5 seconds as indicated by the ``<Interval>``
tag. In the example, the AMPS administration interface is additionally
configured to save the statistics in the ``stats.db`` file, which will
be created in the directory where AMPS was started.

Introduction to SQLite3
------------------------

This section is a quick reference to sqlite3. It is intended to help get
started in examining the statistics provided by AMPS. While this guide
will be sufficient to execute the examples listed, a more comprehensive
guide of the sqlite3 command line tool is available at
http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite.html.

The sqlite3 tools

Starting sqlite3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To start sqlite3 with the stats.db file simply type:

.. code-block:: bash

     $> sqlite3 ./stats.db

This will create a command prompt that looks like the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $> sqlite3 ./stats.db
    SQLite version 3.7.3
    Enter ".help" for instructions
    Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
    sqlite>

To exit the sqlite3 prompt at any time, use the Ctrl+d sequence.

Simple SQLite3 commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tables
~~~~~~

To get a listing of all available tables in the sqlite database type the
``.table`` command.

.. build note: the documentation repository contains a bash script that takes a database and produces nicely-formatted output of the tables in the script

.. code-block:: bash

    sqlite> .table
    HCPUS_DYNAMIC                   IMEMORY_CACHES_DYNAMIC
    HCPUS_STATIC                    IMEMORY_CACHES_STATIC
    HDISKS_DYNAMIC                  IMEMORY_DYNAMIC
    HDISKS_STATIC                   IMEMORY_STATIC
    HMEMORY_DYNAMIC                 IPROCESSORS_DYNAMIC
    HMEMORY_STATIC                  IPROCESSORS_STATIC
    HNET_DYNAMIC                    IQUEUES_DYNAMIC
    HNET_STATIC                     IQUEUES_STATIC
    ICLIENTS_DYNAMIC                IREPLICATIONS_DYNAMIC
    ICLIENTS_STATIC                 IREPLICATIONS_STATIC
    ICONFLATEDTOPICS_DYNAMIC        ISOW_DYNAMIC
    ICONFLATEDTOPICS_STATIC         ISOW_STATIC
    ICONSOLE_LOGGERS_DYNAMIC        ISTATISTICS_DYNAMIC
    ICONSOLE_LOGGERS_STATIC         ISTATISTICS_STATIC
    ICPUS_DYNAMIC                   ISUBSCRIPTIONS_DYNAMIC
    ICPUS_STATIC                    ISUBSCRIPTIONS_STATIC
    IFILE_LOGGERS_DYNAMIC           ISYSLOG_LOGGERS_DYNAMIC
    IFILE_LOGGERS_STATIC            ISYSLOG_LOGGERS_STATIC
    IGLOBALS_DYNAMIC                ITRANSPORTS_DYNAMIC
    IGLOBALS_STATIC                 ITRANSPORTS_STATIC
    ILIFETIMES_DYNAMIC              IVIEWS_DYNAMIC
    ILIFETIMES_STATIC               IVIEWS_STATIC


Schema
~~~~~~

To view the schema for any table type: ``.schema <table name>``, where ``<table name>`` is the name of the table to inspect.

.. code-block:: bash

    sqlite> .schema IFILE_LOGGERS_DYNAMIC

    CREATE TABLE IFILE_LOGGERS_DYNAMIC( timestamp integer,
    static_id integer, bytes_written integer, PRIMARY
    KEY( timestamp, static_id ) );

Statistics Table Design
-------------------------

This section describes the philosophy of how the AMPS tables are
designed within the statistics database. This chapter also includes some
examples of some useful queries which can give an administrator more
information than just the raw data would normally give them. Such
information can be a powerful tool in diagnosing perceived problems in
AMPS.

Table Naming Scheme
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tables in the database use the following naming scheme:

.. code-block:: bash

    <I|H><STAT>_<STATIC|DYNAMIC>
    Where:
    I = AMPS instance statistics
    H = Host statistics
    STAT = The statistics that are collected (MEMORY, CPUS,
    SUBSCRIPTIONS, etc)
    STATIC = attributes that rarely change for an object
    (such as client name, CPU #)
    DYNAMIC = stats that are expected to change on every
    sample (rates, counters, and so on)

Example Queries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To view which clients have fallen behind at one time, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    sqlite> SELECT s.client_name, MAX(d.queue_max_latency),
    MAX(queued_bytes_out) FROM ICLIENTS_DYNAMIC d
    JOIN ICLIENTS_STATIC s ON (s.static_id=d.static_id)
    GROUP BY s.client_name;

To view clients that are behind in the latest sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    sqlite> SELECT s.client_name, d.queue_max_latency,
    queued_bytes_out FROM ICLIENTS_DYNAMIC d
    JOIN ICLIENTS_STATIC s ON (s.static_id=d.static_id)
    WHERE d.timestamp = (SELECT MAX(d.timestamp)
    FROM ICLIENTS_DYNAMIC d) AND d.queue_max_latency > 0;

Using the amps-sqlite3 Script
-----------------------------

The AMPS distribution includes a convenience script, ``amps-sqlite3``,
for easily running queries against a statistics database. This script
requires a Python 2.6 or 2.7 interpreter that includes the sqlite3
module. Most Linux distributions meet this requirement in the default
installation.

The script takes two parameters, as shown below:

+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| **Parameter**   | **Description**                                          |
+=================+==========================================================+
| ::              | The sqlite3 database file to query.                      |
|                 |                                                          |
|     database    |                                                          |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| ::              | The query to run. Notice that the query must be enclosed |
|                 | in quotes.                                               |
|     query       |                                                          |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

**Table 34.1:** *Parameters for amps-sqlite3*

The ``amps-sqlite3`` script joins the ``STATIC`` and ``DYNAMIC`` tables
together, making a single table that is easier to query on. For example,
the script joins the ``ICLIENTS_DYNAMIC`` and ``ICLIENTS_STATIC`` tables
together into a single ``ICLIENTS`` table.

The ``amps-sqlite3`` wrapper also provides a set of convienience
functions that can be included in the query. These functions are
evaluated before the query is presentd to the sqlite3 database engine.

+----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Option**                 | **Description**                                                |
+============================+================================================================+
| ISO8601(*timestamp*)       | Convert ``timestamp`` to an ISO8601 format string.             |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| ISO8601_local(*timestamp*) | Convert ``timestamp`` to an ISO8601 format                     |
|                            | string in the local timezone.                                  |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| timestamp(*string*)        | Convert the provided ISO8601 format ``string`` to a timestamp. |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

**Table 34.2:** *Convenience functions in amps-sqlite3*

To use the ``amps-sqlite3`` script, simply provide the file name of the
database to query and the query to run. For example, the following query
returns the set of samples AMPS has recorded for the ``system_percent``
consumed on each CPU while the instance has been running:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ amps-sqlite3 stats.db "select iso8601(timestamp),system_percent from hcpus order by timestamp"

SQLite Tips and Troubleshooting
--------------------------------

This section includes information on SQLite tasks that may not be
immediately obvious, and troubleshooting information on SQLite.

Converting AMPS statistics time to an ISO8601 Datetime
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This Python function shows how to converts an AMPS timestamp to an
ISO8601 datetime. You can use the equivalent in your language of choice
to convert between the timestamps recorded in the statistics database
and ISO8601 timestamps.

.. code-block:: bash

    def iso8601_time(amps_time):
    """
    Converts AMPS Stats time into an ISO8601 datetime.
    """
    pt = float(amps_time)/1000 - 210866803200 # subtract the unix epoch
    it = int(pt)
    ft = pt-it
    return time.strftime("%Y%m%dT%H%M%S",time.localtime(it)) + ("%.6f" % ft)[1:]                

Troubleshooting "Database Disk Image is Malformed"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To repair this error, you need to extract the data from the SQLite
datastore and create a new datastore. To do this:

1. Open the sqlite datastore. For example, if the database store is
   named ``stats.db``, the command would be:

.. code-block:: xml

    sqlite3 stats.db

2. Dump the data into a SQL script.

.. code-block:: bash

    .mode insert
    .output stats_data.sql
    .dump
    .exit

This creates a series of SQL commands that recreate the data in the
database.

3. Make sure that the script commits updates (depending on the version
   of sqlite3 and the state of the database, the script may roll back
   the updates rather than committing them without this step).

.. code-block:: bash

   sed -i 's/^ROLLBACK;/COMMIT;/ig' stats_data.sql

4. Now create a new database file using the SQL commands.

.. code-block:: bash

    sqlite3 good.db < stats_data.sql

Finally, adjust the configuration of the Admin server to use the new
database (in this example, ``good.db``) or copy the new database over
the old database.
