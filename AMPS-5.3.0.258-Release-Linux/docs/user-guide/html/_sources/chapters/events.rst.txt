21. Event Topics
================

AMPS publishes specific events to internal topics that begin with the
``/AMPS/`` prefix, which is reserved for AMPS only. For example, all
client connectivity events are published to the internal
``/AMPS/ClientStatus`` topic. This allows all clients to monitor for
events that may be of interest.

+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| |tip|   | Event topic messages can be subscribed with content filters like |
|         | any other topic within AMPS.                                     |
+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------+

A client may subscribe to event topics on any connection with a message
type that supports views. This includes all of the default message types
and ``bson``, but does not include the ``binary`` message type.

Messages are delivered as the message type for the connection. For
example, if the connection uses JSON messages, the event topic messages
with be JSON. A connection that uses FIX will receive FIX messages from
an event topic.
