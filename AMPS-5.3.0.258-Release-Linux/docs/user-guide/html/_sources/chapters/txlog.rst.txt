14. Transactional Messaging and Bookmark Subscriptions
=======================================================

AMPS includes support for transactional messaging, which includes
persistence, consistency across restarts, and message replay. AMPS
message queues use the transaction log to hold the messages in the
queue. Transactional messaging is also the basis for replication, a key
component of the high-availability capability in AMPS (as described in
:ref:`#ug-ha`). 

AMPS message queues use the transaction log as a
persistent record of the messages that have entered the queue, the order
of those messages, and which messages have been acknowledged and removed
from the queue. All of these capabilities rely on the AMPS *transaction
log*. The transaction log maintains a record of messages. You can choose
which messages are included in the transaction log by specifying the
message types and topics you want to record.

The AMPS transaction log differs from transaction logging in a
conventional relational database system. Unlike transaction logs that
are intended solely to maintain the consistency of data in the system,
the AMPS transaction log is fully queryable through the AMPS client
APIs. For applications that need access to historical information, or
applications that need to be able to recover state in the event of a
client restart, the transaction log allows you to do this, relying on
AMPS as the definitive single version of the state of the application.
There is no need for complex logic to handle reconciliation or state
restoration in the client. AMPS handles the difficult parts of this
process, and the transaction log guarantees consistency.

Topics covered by a transaction log are able to provide reliable
messaging with strict consistency guarantees.

When a transaction log is enabled, topics covered by the transaction log
provide *atomic broadcast* from that instance. This means that the
instance enforces a repeatable ordering on the messages, and guarantees
that all subscribers receive messages reliably, in a consistent order,
and with no gaps or duplicates.

Enabling a transaction log in an instance also enables the following
behaviors:

* When a transaction log is enabled, AMPS uses the client name provided
  by each client to manage the sequencing and integrity of the message
  stream, and to quickly detect and respond to reconnection. To allow this,
  each connection to AMPS must have a unique client name. If a duplicate
  client name is detected, one of the clients is assumed to be defunct and
  is disconnected.

* When a transaction log is enabled, persisted acknowledgements to a publish
  are conflated, as described in :ref:`#ug-ack-conflation`.
