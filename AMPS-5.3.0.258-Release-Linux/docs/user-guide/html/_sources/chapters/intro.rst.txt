Organization of this Manual
---------------------------

This manual is divided into the following parts:

-  Part One presents introductory material and a brief
   overview of AMPS

-  Part Two explains the features of AMPS, including
   information on the following features:

   *  :ref:`Publish and Subscribe<#ug-pub_sub>`
   *  :ref:`Transactional Messaging and Bookmark Subscriptions<#ug-txlog>`
   *  :ref:`Message Queues<#ug-queues>`
   *  :ref:`Message Types<#ug-messagetypes>`
   *  :ref:`State of the World (SOW)<#ug-sow>`

      State of the World topics enable many of the other advanced
      features in AMPS, such as:

      -  :ref:`Aggregating Data with View Topics<#ug-views>`
      -  :ref:`Conflated Topics <#ug-topic_replicas>`
      -  :ref:`Delta Messaging <#ug-delta>`
      -  :ref:`Out-of-Focus Messages (OOF)<#ug-oof>`

      This section also contains detailed chapters on specific topics,
      such as the AMPS filter language. Both application developers and
      administrators should become familiar with this section.

-  Part Three discusses AMPS deployment and
   operations, including:

   *  :ref:`Running AMPS as a Linux Service <#ug-daemon>`
   *  :ref:`Logging <#ug-logging>`
   *  :ref:`Event Topics <#ug-event-topics>`
   *  :ref:`Monitoring Interface <#ug-monitoring>`
   *  :ref:`Automating AMPS with Actions <#ug-actions>`
   *  :ref:`Replication and High-Availability <#ug-ha>`
   *  :ref:`Operation and Deployment <#ug-operation>`
   *  :ref:`Securing AMPS <#ug-securing>`
   *  :ref:`Troubleshooting AMPS <#ug-troubleshooting>`

   This section is most useful for those with a focus on AMPS
   operations, although the information presented here is helpful for
   developers who want to design high-performance, high-availability
   applications that are easy to deploy and maintain.

-  Part Fourpresents information about using AMPS to
   build applications including:

   -  :ref:`Simple Use Cases <#ug-usecases>`
