20. Logging
===========

AMPS supports logging to many different targets including the console,
syslog, and files. Every error message within AMPS is uniquely
identified and can be filtered out or explicitly included in the logger
output. This chapter of the *AMPS User Guide* describes the AMPS logger
configuration and the unique settings for each logging target.
