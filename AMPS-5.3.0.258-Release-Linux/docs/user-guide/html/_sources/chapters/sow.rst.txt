7. State of the World (SOW)
============================

One of the core features of AMPS is the ability to persist the most
recent update for each distinct message published to a given topic. The
State of the World (SOW) can be thought of as a database where messages
published to AMPS are filtered into topics, and where the topics store
the latest update to each distinct message. The State of the World gives
subscribers the ability to quickly resolve any differences between their
data and updated data in the SOW by querying the current state of a
topic, or any set of messages inside a topic. Topics recorded in the
State of the World are also used for caching data, providing "point in
time" snapshots of active data flows, providing key/value stores over
data flows, and so on. Topics recorded in the State of the World are the
underlying sources for AMPS aggregation and analytics capabilities, and
the ability to store the previous state of a message is the foundation
of advanced messaging features such as delta messaging and out of focus
notifications.

AMPS also provides the ability to keep historical snapshots of the
contents of the State of the World, which allows subscribers to query
the contents of the SOW at a particular point in time and replay changes
from that point in time.

AMPS can maintain the SOW for a topic in a persistent file, which will
be available across restarts of the AMPS server. The SOW can also be
*transient*, in which case the state of the SOW does not persist across
server restarts.

Topics do not keep the current values in the SOW by default. To provide
this capability for a topic, you must configure AMPS to maintain the
topic in the State of the World by adding a definition for the ``Topic``
to the ``SOW`` section of the AMPS configuration file.
