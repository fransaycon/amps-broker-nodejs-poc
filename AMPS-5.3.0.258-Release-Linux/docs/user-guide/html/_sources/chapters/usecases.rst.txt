29. Sample Use Cases
====================

To further your understanding of AMPS, we provide some sample use cases
that highlight how multiple AMPS features can be leveraged in larger
messaging solutions. For example, AMPS is often used as a back-end
persistent data store for client desktop applications.

The provided use case shows how a client application can use the AMPS
command ``sow_and_subscribe`` to populate an order table that is
continually kept up-to-date. To limit redundant data from being sent to
the GUI, we show how you can use a delta subscription command. You will
also see how to improve performance and protect the GUI from
over-subscription by using the ``TopN`` query limiter along with a
``stats`` acknowledgment.
