8. SOW Queries
===============

When SOW topics are configured inside an AMPS instance, clients can
issue SOW queries to AMPS to retrieve all of the messages matching a
given topic and content filter. When a query is executed, AMPS will test
each message in the SOW against the content filter specified and all
messages matching the filter will be returned to the client. The topic
can be a straight topic or a regular expression pattern.
