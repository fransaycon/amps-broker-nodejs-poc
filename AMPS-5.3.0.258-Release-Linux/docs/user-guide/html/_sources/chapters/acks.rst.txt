17. Command Acknowledgment
===========================

AMPS command processing is designed to be asynchronous. The design of
the server makes it possible for an application to send a command to
AMPS, and receive the results of that command at a later time.
Acknowledgment of commands is always optional: the server makes no
requirement that an application request acknowledgment. The AMPS client
libraries automatically request the acknowledgments required to
maintain the guarantees the client API provides.

The status and results of a command are returned to a client in the form
of an acknowledgment, or ``ack``, message. AMPS can return status
updates at various checkpoints throughout the command processing
sequence.

For many applications, it may not be necessary for the application to
request message acknowledgments explicitly. The AMPS clients request a
set of acknowledgments by default that balance performance with error
detection.

AMPS supports a variety of ``ack`` types, and allows you to request
multiple ack types on each command. For example, the received ack type
requests that AMPS acknowledge when the command is received, while the
completed ack type requests that AMPS acknowledge when it has completed
the command (or the portion of the command that runs immediately). Each
AMPS command supports a different set of types, and the precise meaning
of the ``ack`` returned depends on the command that AMPS is
acknowledging.

AMPS commands are inherently *asynchronous*, and AMPS does not provide
acknowledgment messages by default. A client must both explicitly
request an acknowledgment and then receive and process that
acknowledgment to know the results of a command. It is normal for time
to elapse between the request and the acknowledgment, and so AMPS
acknowledgments provide ways to correlate the acknowledgment with the
command that produced it. This is typically done with an identifier that
the client assigns to a command, which is then returned in the
acknowledgment for the command.

AMPS supports the acknowledgment types listed in the following table:

+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| **Acknowledgment Type**  | **General Description**                          |
+==========================+==================================================+
| ``completed``            | The command (or a portion of the command) has    |
|                          | completed.                                       |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| ``persisted``            | The results of the command have been persisted   |
|                          | to durable storage.                              |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| ``processed``            | AMPS has processed the command.                  |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| ``received``             | AMPS has received the command.                   |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| ``stats``                | AMPS returns statistics associated with the      |
|                          | command.                                         |

**Table 17.1:** *AMPS acknowledgment messages*

Acknowledgments for different commands may not arrive in the order that
commands were submitted to AMPS. For example, a ``publish`` command to a
topic that uses synchronous replication will not return a ``persisted``
acknowledgment until the synchronous replication destinations have
persisted the message. If the client issues a ``subscribe`` command in
the meantime, the ``processed`` acknowledgment for the ``subscribe``
command -- indicating that AMPS has processed the subscription request
-- may well return before the ``persisted`` acknowledgment.

Not all commands support all acknowledgment types, and the meaning of
each acknowledgment may differ depending on the command submitted. The
acknowledgements for different commands set different fields on an
acknowledgement message. See the *AMPS Command Reference* for details.

.. _#ug-ack-requesting:

Requesting Acknowledgments
---------------------------

Acknowledgments from the AMPS server are always optional. The AMPS
clients will request acknowledgments as necessary for processing and
error reporting. In addition, an application can request acknowledgments
as necessary to meet the requirements of an application.

The *AMPS Command Guide* contains information on the acknowledgment types
available for each command and the meaning of those acknowledgments.


.. _#ug-ack-receiving:

Receiving Acknowledgments
---------------------------

Acknowledgments for a specific command or subscription are delivered as a
part of the message stream for that command. In an AMPS client, this means
that whatever method an application is using to receive responses from AMPS
will include acknowledgment messages.

Acknowledgments from AMPS have a command type of ``ack``. This command type
is reserved for responses from AMPS to a client. The ``CommandId`` of the
acknowledgment message contains the ``CommandId`` provided by the client
on the command that AMPS is responding to. The client uses this ``CommandId``
to route the acknowledgment message to the correct message processor in
the application.

Notice that when acknowledgments are *conflated* -- that is, the
acknowledgment refers to a number of publish commands -- AMPS does not include
a command ID in the acknowledgment message. Further details are provided at
:ref:`#ug-ack-conflation`. 

.. _#ug-ack-completed:

Bookmark Subscriptions and Completed Acknowledgments
-------------------------------------------------------

When AMPS is processing a bookmark subscription, a ``completed``
acknowledgment indicates that the subscription has completed replay from the
transaction log. This means that the subscription has reached the point in
the transaction log at which the subscribe command was received, and
messages delivered on the subscription after the ``completed`` acknowledgment
are from new publishes.

Bookmark Subscriptions and Persisted Acknowledgments
-------------------------------------------------------

A bookmark subscription typically also requests the ``persisted``
acknowledgement (the AMPS clients do this automatically). In this case,
once replay reaches the end of the transaction log,
AMPS periodically returns an acknowledgement that includes the last
bookmark written to the local transaction log. This information helps
with application recovery, particularly in cases where publishers are
intermittent or low-volume, and the last message for a subscription is
significantly older than the last message evaluated for delivery to
the subscription.

.. _#ug-ack-conflation:

Acknowledgment Conflation and Publish Acknowledgments
-------------------------------------------------------

For some commands, AMPS will *conflate* acknowledgments and return
acknowledgments for multiple commands at one time. When AMPS conflates
acknowledgments, AMPS provides an identifier other than the command
identifier that describes which commands the acknowledgment applies to.

For example, when a transaction log is configured, AMPS conflates
``persisted`` acknowledgments in response to ``publish`` commands
and ``sow_delete`` commands. These conflated
acknowledgments contain the last client sequence number that the
acknowledgment applies to rather than the command identifiers or
sequence numbers for all messages being acknowledged. For example, if an
application publishes messages with sequence numbers ``1``, ``2``,
``3``, ``4``, and ``5``, and message ``3`` fails due to entitlement
restrictions, AMPS will return an ``ack`` indicating success for message
``2``, an ``ack`` indicating failure for message ``3``, and an ``ack``
indicating success for message ``5``.

By default, AMPS produces conflated acknowledgments for a given connection
approximately once a second.

Starting with version 5.2.3.0, AMPS allows configuration of the
conflation interval.

* To set a different conflation interval
  for an individual client, provide an ``ack_conflation`` option in
  the options string for the logon for that client. This sets the
  interval at which AMPS will provide acknowledgements to that client.

* To set a different conflation interval for replication acknowledgements,
  specify the ``AckConflationInterval`` in the replication ``Destination``.
  This sets the interval at which the downstream AMPS server will provide
  acknowledgements to this AMPS server. 

Notice that when a publisher is publishing to a replicated topic, the
``ack_conflation`` interval sets the interval at which AMPS acknowledges
messages that have already been acknowledged by synchronous replication
destinations, while the ``AckConflationInterval`` specifies how often
those downstream destinations produce an acknowledgement. In a situation
where it is important to reduce the default latency of an acknowledgement,
**both** the server option and the client side option typically need to be set. 

To see more information about the different commands and their supported
acknowledgment types, please refer to the *AMPS Command Reference*,
provided with 4.0 and greater versions of the AMPS clients and available
on the 60East web site.
